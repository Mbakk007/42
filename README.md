## 📋 About

This repository contains my solutions to 42 School projects.  Each project is designed to teach specific programming concepts.

## 📚 Projects

### Project 1: Libft
Libft - A custom implementation of the C standard library, recreating essential functions (string, memory, character operations) plus additional utilities. This serves as a reusable library for all future 42 projects.

### Project 2: ft_printf
Recreation of printf. Handles variadic arguments and multiple format specifiers (%c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %p, %%).

### Project 3: get_next_line
A function that reads and returns a single line from a file descriptor, one at a time, regardless of line length.
Implements static variables and buffer management to handle multiple FDs simultaneously with configurable BUFFER_SIZE.

All projects follow the 42 School Norm.
